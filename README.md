# AI_Project_ECE57000
AI Plane routing project for ECE 57000 (An AI course at IUPUI).

This is not the final build of the project. This project was used for a research paper, 
and is a very sophisticated and instructive piece of code. As such, I have included a version of it that does
most of the functionality, but only works for one given image and does not output the final generation to the python
script that animates the output. This repo is just a proof of concept for those interested in the learning aspect of the project
